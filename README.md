# WebRTC Video Chat
## Info
This is a minimalist text and video chat implemented with vanilla JS, WebRTC and Socket.IO.

I decided for a lightweight approach in order to test the WebRTC technology with as the smallest overhead.

## Usage
- Pull the code
- Run `npm i` in the /server folder
- Run `node app.js` in the /server folder to start the Socket.IO server (port: 5000)
- Serve the index.html file using your favourite web server
- Open two browser windows and navigate to index.html
- Click on 'Join chat' in both windows. Once two users have connected, click 'Call with video' to start the video chat
